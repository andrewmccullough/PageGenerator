We wanted to let you know how much we&rsquo;ve appreciated your friendship, mentorship, and hard work over the years, and to wish you the best as you start your careers after commissioning.

	                <p>Dear AS400 Cadets, </p><p>Congratulations!!! YOU DID IT! You made it. I can't bet how surreal that must feel. You have just completed four arduous, productive, successful, and fun years of Air Force ROTC. That is a major accomplishment that you saw through till the very end, even with a whole pandemic thrown into the mix. All of the underclassmen admire your perseverance and literally want to be you right now. However, we know it takes a certain kind of Cadet to get there, so for the mean time we're looking up to you, learning, and modeling ourselves after your expertise and leadership, so that one day we can be exceptional graduating Cadets as well. Best of luck in the big blue Air Force. HOOOah!</p>

	                <p>Congratulations, what you have been working towards is finally here! Although, it hasn't looked exactly what you probably imagined, the lessons you've learned and experiences you have made won't ever leave you. Your class has done a great job of preparing, equipping, and modeling for the underclassmen in ROTC. Many of you have been so important to my own development. Never forget the memories and the lessons, they will always be there to guide you. We love you all, and wish you the absolute best! </p>

	                <p>To the AS 400s,</p><p>As I have become acquainted with the AFRTOC universe this year, I've been impressed time and time again by your leadership, professionalism, and organization. Oh, how smoothly things run at Det 890--all due to you! Everyone has a purpose, everyone is on the same page, and everyone is working together. When things don't go according to plan, you quickly adapt. You've worked hard all year to train and prepare the classes below you, and you've modeled the way for us all. I've felt supported and taken care of, and I've noticed just how much time and energy each of you dedicates to being outstanding. Thank you for helping ROTC feel like a family, for preparing us so well, and for lovingly passing the torch. I wish that we had time to properly celebrate all your efforts and accomplishments, but I know that you'll all move on to bigger and better things in no time. Best of luck next year!</p>

	                <p>Thank you for all of the continuous support through these past two years!! From CCT to FTP every ounce of effort that you have put towards making us better cadets is well appreciated! I'm really sad that I won't be able to say goodbye to you all in person and wish you the best of luck in the big Air Force while probably accidentally missing a greeting :) Thank you for seeing the best in me and understanding the strength of every individual towards the improvement of the detachment. You've helped to shape some of the best cadets I've seen and I know that although it will be sad to leave dear old UVA, the world is out there waiting for you! </p>

	                <p>Thank you, Class of 2020 for being helpful, flexible and reliable throughout this confusing and challenging semester. Y'all have set an extremely high bar for the rest of Det 890, and your impacts on the rest of us cadets will not be forgotten. I wish y'all the best of luck in your careers and look forward to hearing of your accomplishments in the Air Force. Thank you for being so open and willing to help us, even the 100s. It means a lot to be able to come to you outside of ROTC if we have a problem or issue and know that you'll be there to help! Thanks again, and best of luck!!</p>

	                <p>Dear seniors, </p><p>Thank you for everything you have taught us over these past couples of years. Starting ROTC as a freshman, you helped us learn the ropes and the do's and dont's of ROTC. You worked alongside us and helped teach us how to survive our 200 year. Not gonna lie when y'all came back from Field Training it was a bit awkward at first but you worked hard to mentor us and challenged us to become better cadets. After we got back from Field Training, you continued to mentor us and helped us learn the ropes of becoming a POC. I know this year didn't end like we all would have liked, but know that we are so thankful for all you have taught us and we know you're going to do great things in the big blue! :)</p>

	                <p>Thank you 400s for the great year of ROTC! Not only have you all done a great job of managing our training for this year, but you have also acted as friendly mentors and encouraged us to be better than we thought we could. I hope you all are blessed going into this next stage of life as an officer in the Air Force. If I see you all around, I look forward to calling you lieutenant!</p>

	                <p>It has been nothing short of a pleasure to go through this ROTC experience with you all. You set the example for us, especially entering the POC. As a matter of fact, there were several times during my 200 year where I was not sure if I would be an effective POC or not or if I would be successful at FT, because there is just so much to learn. However, an inspiring thought for me throughout that learning process was over the previous year watching how much your class grew into the leaders you are today. I knew I could do it because you all had done it and were always there to help support us throught that process. I fully expect every single one of you to continue to make an impact on the lives of those around you and to be there for your fellow Airmen upon commissioning! Thanks again for being awesome!</p>

	                <p>Dear Graduating Cadets,</p><p>Thank you so much for everything you’ve done for us this past year. I’ve only been in AFROTC for a semester and a half, but that was long enough for you to make great impressions on me. From being funny, to dedicated, to supportive, you were great role models and helped us understand what kind of cadets we should strive to be. I could tell that you cared about what you were doing and that meant so much to me and my peers. I wish the best for you all and your future endeavors! Thank you for all you’ve done.</p>

	                <p>Soon-to-be Lieutenants,</p><p>Congratulations! Soon 4+ years of hard work and dedication will have paid off and you'll officially be commissioned officers in the United States Air Force. At one level or another, I have gotten to know many of you and your leadership abilities. I can say honestly that wherever your first assignment takes you, the airmen under you, and even the airmen over you, will be extremely lucky to have one of you as a lieutenant in their respective unit. The leadership and professionalism I have witnessed from my 2 years at the detachment have certainly proven this to me. Thanks for all your hard work and dedication to this detachment and to the training of the GMC, and thank you for your future service. God bless.</p>

	                <p>Although I am a 100 and have only had a short season to get to know everyone, I wanted to let you know how influential and vital you have been to me and this detachment. I know I speak for many GMC when I say that we saw the pride and leadership you all possess with poise. For someone like myself, who had no prior military knowledge, coming into my first year of ROTC was difficult and quite overwhelming. During those challenging times, I may have felt differently about the positive influence that the program would have on my life, but now I look back at this past year and I am thankful. I may want to forget the constant fear of figuring out whether the POC twenty feet in front of me was male or female and analyzing their face to match a name before it was too late; or fumbling over my words saying “good morning” when in reality it was 7 p.m. at night. Yet, I will remember how thankful I am that God put me in ROTC at Detachment 890 to have you all teach and guide me, as well as, thankful that you demanded nothing but excellence, not only from yourself as leaders, but also from your fellow peers, and from us GMC below. I have been in situations in my past where leaders over me were toxic. They did not care about the program or those participating. They lacked passion, became prideful and simply slacked off once they held a position of leadership, all with the excuse that it was their last year to just have fun. Their leadership, or lack of, set the tone for everyone else to follow and I watched as those with so much potential became apathetic and unmotivated. But not with you. Never once did I sense this arrogance. I saw selfless leaders who understood the importance of their role in our detachment, as well as, their role in fighting for our country. I saw leaders who deeply cared and displayed guidance as well as character that will shape the future of the U.S. Air Force and our world. Thank you for providing me with someone to look up to and aspire to be in the future. I know God has an amazing plan for your lives as you have already touched mine.</p>

	                <p>Thanks for being an inspiration to everyone at Det 890, and showing us what great cadets truly look like. Everything I know about ROTC is due to the training from you guys, and I'm trying my best to pass all of your knowledge to the cadets younger than me. You are an incredibly strong group of people to be able to manage the hardships today's circumstances have brought your class specifically. You've all been great cadets and I'm sure you'll be even better officers. The Air Force is a small world - I'm looking forward to seeing all of you again on active duty.</p>

You all have spent years looking up to others in the years ahead of you; learning, understanding, and watching how those who have commissioned before you did. Now you have finally made it, all your hard work, sleep deprivation, countless push-ups, knowledge, and numerous trials have lead to you graduating and leading countless people. You have inspired me and every GMC with your dedication on and off the clock. All of us hope to one day hope to be half as memorable as you all. Although these are unprecedented times, you all graduating have made this a year to remember. Thank you for your hard work, words of advice, and for sharing your experience so that others can learn. No words can epitomize your outstanding potential as you will go on to be officers in the World's Greatest Air Force fueled by innovation and powered by you.</p>
